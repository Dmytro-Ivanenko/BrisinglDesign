# Brisingl Design â€“ Portfolio Landing Page

This is a simple one-page portfolio website I built for my girlfriend as part of her college project. Sheâ€™s studying web design, and this landing page was made to help her present herself, show a few sample projects, and include contact information.

## Purpose

- Quick personal intro
- Showcase of 3 portfolio projects
- Easy way to get in touch (email, Instagram, Behance)

## Built With

- HTML5 for layout
- CSS for styling (with Normalize.css)
- Google Fonts for typography
- Minimal JavaScript (setup for future use)
