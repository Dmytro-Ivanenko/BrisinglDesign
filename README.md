# 💫 Brisingl Design – Personal Portfolio Landing

This is a custom-designed personal portfolio landing page I created as a gift for my girlfriend — a talented web designer. The site reflects her design philosophy, showcases her projects, and makes it easy for visitors to contact her.

## 🌸 Purpose

- Introduces her design style
- Showcases selected portfolio work
- Presents her contact info in a warm, professional way

## 🧩 Features

- Clean, minimal layout with vintage vibes
- Custom typography and visual moodboard
- Fully responsive structure
- Light scripting for future interactivity

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – semantic layout structure
- **SCSS/CSS** – custom styling + Normalize.css for consistent browser defaults
- **JavaScript** – light structure for future enhancements
- **Google Fonts** – Instrument Sans, Jacques Francois, Josefin Slab
